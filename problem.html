							<pre><code>It is essential to develop a simple-to-implement checkup solution for pregnant women to use at home.</code></pre>
							<p> Since the declaration of COVID -19 as a global health emergency by the WHO in March 2020, there has been a growing burden and overloaded capacity in hospitals worldwide [1]. Among different healthcare services, prenatal care has been further detrimentally affected due to COVID-19 pandemic, where most of the clinical resources has been directed to cope with the situation leaving a huge void. Being afraid of catching the virus while visiting the hospitals, many pregnant women also choose to skip check-ups until a safer time. As a consequence, fetal health declines on a large scale which also leads to mothers’ mental issues like devastation and anxiety [2]. To cope with the pandemic, there has been a growing demand and implementation of telehealth technology to help pregnant women connect with obstetricians for regular visits from afar, with a notable example in New York City [3]. However, those telehealth solutions focus solely on initiating digital conversations between pregnant women and obstetricians and have not yet incorporated any techniques to monitor fetal status continuously at home to provide on-site obstetricians with valuable information. Therefore, It is essential to develop a simple-to-implement checkup solution for pregnant women to use at home, raise people’s awareness of prenatal care and release the burden on the healthcare system, especially during hard times like the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
							<pre><code>Currently there is no reliable way to assess a baby's heart rate at home</code></pre>
							<p>The challenge for home-based devices is to minimize unnecessary clinical consultation while not missing the opportunity to intervene if the unborn baby is at risk. There is no reliable way to assess a baby's heart rate at home except with a home-used consumer ultrasound Doppler fetal heart rate device that is notorious in difficulty to find the fetal heart beats, often causing even more alarm to the other. Therefore, we introduce the <i> Nemo belt – a wearable device for remote fetal and maternal health monitoring.</i></p>
